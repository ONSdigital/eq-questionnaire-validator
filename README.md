# eq-questionnaire-validator

An API for validating survey schemas.

## Setup

```
brew install pyenv
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools pipenv
pipenv install --dev
```

## Running

To run the app:

```
pipenv run ./scripts/run_app.sh
```

## Testing

By default, all schemas in the `tests/schemas/valid` directory will be evaluated as part of the unit tests.
Any errors in these schemas will cause a failure.

To run the app's unit tests:

```
pipenv run ./scripts/run_tests_unit.sh
```

To test the apps functionality:
```
pipenv run ./scripts/run_app.sh
```

Then, in another terminal window/tab, navigate to a checked out copy of eq-survey-runner:
```
pipenv run ./scripts/test_schemas.sh --local
```

# Installing node dependencies

In the eq-schema-validator directory, install node version manager (nvm) and node using the following commands:

```
brew install nvm
nvm install
```

Install yarn and node dependencies:

```
npm i -g yarn
yarn 
```

## Formatting json

Run the following to format all json files in the schemas directory:

```
yarn gulp format
````

## Validating with ajv

Also included is a node based version of the json schema validation which may be used during development to assist with
debugging errors. This returns more errors than we'd currently like due to the way polymorphism works for each of our
blocks.

Run the ajv based version of validator from within the ajv/ directory.

```
DEBUG=validator node app.js
```

This returns either an empty json response when the questionnaire is valid, or a response containing an "errors" key.
The errors are ordered by their path length and with first error message being the deepest path into the schema and
should represent the best match for the questionnaire which has been posted.
