# eq-questionnaire-validator

An API for validating survey schemas.

## Setup

In order to run locally you'll need Node.js, Poetry and Python installed. It's recommended that Python is installed via pyenv but pyenv is optional.

### Install NVM and pyenv

NVM and pyenv will manage your versions of Node and Python and these commands will install the required versions of them which will be read from `.nvmrc` and `.python-version`.

``` shell
brew install nvm pyenv
nvm use
pyenv install
```

If you get a message in the command line after running `nvm use` that the version of Node specified in the `.nvmrc` file isn't installed, just follow the commands to install it.

e.g.
``` shell
nvm install v22.15.0
```

### Install JS dependencies

``` shell
npm install
```

### Install Poetry and Python dependencies

``` shell
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - --version 2.1.2
poetry install
```

## Running locally

To run the app:
``` shell
make run
```

Validator runs on two ports, `5001` is the main validator app and `5002` is Ajv validator.

### Validator

Validator runs on `http://localhost:5001/validate` and accepts GET and POST requests.

If you need to change the port you can change the port variable in the Uvicorn settings in api.py:
``` python
uvicorn.run("api:app", workers=20, port=5001, reload=True)
```
The reload flag here will allow the service to restart if you make a change to the code, if you want to run the app locally using multiple server workers you need to set reload to "False".

### Ajv validator

Ajv validator defaults to running on `http://localhost:5002`.

You can override this by setting the `AJV_VALIDATOR_SCHEME`, `AJV_VALIDATOR_HOST`, and `AJV_VALIDATOR_PORT` environment variables.
The defaults for these are:
- `AJV_VALIDATOR_SCHEME` = "http"
- `AJV_VALIDATOR_HOST` = "localhost"
- `AJV_VALIDATOR_PORT` = "5002"

Alternatively, you can override the entire URL by setting the `AJV_VALIDATOR_URL` environment variable directly.

### Running against a URL

Once Validator is running, it can be called directly in the browser using the "/validate" endpoint and the "url" parameter for the address where the schema is located (e.g. GitHub Gist raw json).

As Validator runs on `localhost:5001` by default, here is an example of a command you can use to validate a schema via a URL:
``` shell
http://localhost:5001/validate?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ONSdigital/eq-questionnaire-runner/refs/heads/main/schemas/test/en/test_address.json
```

Only the following URLs and domains are accepted:
- "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/"
- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/"
- "onsdigital.uk"
- "localhost"

Also when using a URL from GitHub you can only validate schemas from the ONSdigital organisation and only against repos with the owner "ONSdigital".

### Running against eQ Runner

Also once you have Validator running it can be used to run against eQ Runner (`https://github.com/ONSdigital/eq-questionnaire-runner`).
If you have eQ Runner spun up you can from within the root of eQ Runner run:
``` shell
make validate-test-schemas
```
This script will run Validator on the test eQ Runner schemas.

### Running the Ajv (server) version of Validator

Running `make run` will start up the both of services required for validation (Ajv validator and the Validator app itself). However, if you want to start Ajv individually, run:
```shell
make start-ajv
```

This defaults to running on port `5002`, set `AJV_VALIDATOR_PORT` in your .env file if you need to change this.

Running the Ajv server returns either an empty json response when the questionnaire is valid, or a response containing an "errors" key. The errors are ordered by their path length and with first error message being the deepest path into the schema and should represent the best match for the questionnaire which has been posted.

To stop the Ajv server:

You will need `AJV_VALIDATOR_PORT` set in your .env file to the port the server is running on, then you can run the following:
``` shell
make stop-ajv
```

### Testing and running against local schemas

By default, all schemas in the `tests/schemas/valid` and `tests/schemas/invalid` directories will be evaluated as part of the unit tests. Any errors in these schemas will cause a failure.

To run the app's unit tests:
``` shell
make test-unit
```

Make sure you don't already have Ajv running on localhost:5002 by running `lsof -i tcp:5002` if you do make a note of the PID (process identifier) and then run `kill -9 <PID>`, replacing "<PID>" with the process id from the previous command.

Run the Ajv validator tests:
``` shell
make test-ajv
```

To run the app's unit tests and Ajv validator tests:
``` shell
make test
```

#### Test the local Validator app against eQ Runner schemas

Spin Validator up with:
``` shell
make run
```

Then, in another terminal, navigate to a checked out copy of `https://github.com/ONSdigital/eq-questionnaire-runner` and run:
``` shell
make validate-test-schemas
```
This will run Validator against all eQ Runner test schemas.

Or you can run it against a specific eQ Runner schema, to do this:
- set the following vars passing them into the following command:
    - `SCHEMA_PATH` to the path of the schema file (if not specified defaults to `./schemas/test/en/`)
    - `SCHEMA` to the schema file name without the `.json`
- then run (for example):
``` shell
make validate-test-schema SCHEMA=test_checkbox SCHEMA_PATH=./schemas/
```

## Formatting/linting json

Run the following to format the JS files in the Ajv folder, the json files in the schemas and test schemas folders and the Python files in the repository:

``` shell
make format
```

Run the following to lint the JS files in the Ajv folder, the json files in the schemas and test schemas folders and the Python files in the repository:

``` shell
make lint
```

## Running with Docker

To install Docker run:

``` shell
brew install docker
```

On MacOS install container runtimes, e.g. Colima:

``` shell
brew install colima
```

Make sure Colima is started every time you want to use Docker images:

``` shell
colima start
```

When PRs are merged in this repo there is a GitHub workflow that builds 2 Docker images one for Validator and one for the Ajv validator and then pushes them to our GAR in GCP. These images can then be pulled down and run locally with Docker. These images are pulled down and run from eQ Runner when `make run validator` is run which uses the `docker-compose-schema-validator.yml` script.

You can do this using these commands:

You will need to be authenticated with GCP to run these, to do this run `gcloud auth login` first

- Validator:

``` shell
docker run -it -p 5001:5001 europe-west2-docker.pkg.dev/ons-eq-ci/docker-images/eq-questionnaire-validator
```

-  Ajv validator:

``` shell
docker run -it -p 5002:5002 europe-west2-docker.pkg.dev/ons-eq-ci/docker-images/eq-questionnaire-validator-ajv
```

To stop these containers you may need to use the `docker kill` command:

First run:

``` shell
docker ps
```

Then make a note of the container id of the container you want to stop and then run (replacing "<CONTAINER_ID>" with the id):

``` shell
docker kill <CONTAINER_ID>
```
